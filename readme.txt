Generates a title upon publishing a post, if no title is given. Optionally works when editing posts as well. It is a must when posting in a hurry.

== Description ==

This plugin gives you the ability to automatically **generate a title for your post**, when upon publishing no title has been given. 

* The title is generated by the first sentence of the post;
* Few simple settings on a dedicated page will allow you to specify the criteria for this to happen (see [screenshot](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/autotitle-for-wordpress/screenshots/));
* It naturally influences what the permalink will be like (if you use `%postname%` in it);
* You can decide to generate a title also when _editing_ a post, again if the title is deliberately left empty.

This plugin is a must if you use Wordpress **posting content in one click and not looking back**, and, in general, if you do not want --or care-- to give titles to your posts, but you want the post permalinks to be a little more meaningful than just numbers.

1. Upload `autotitle-for-wordpress.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
